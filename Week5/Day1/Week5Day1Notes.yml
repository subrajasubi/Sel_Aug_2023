Today's Agenda:
  - 2:30 - 3:30 -> TestNG Introduction
  - 3:30 - 4:00 -> Sequential Execution
  - 4:00 - 4:30 -> Breakout
  - 4:30 - 5:15 -> Parallel Execution
  - 5:15 - 5:30 -> Breakout
  - 5:30 - 6:15 -> Annotations
  - 6:15 - 6:30 -> Breakout

TestNG:
  - Test NextGeneration
  - Cedric Beust
  - Testing/execution Framework

20 -> one by one
Limitaions:
  - Execute testcases one by one
 Expectation:
   - All the tests together may be sequentially / parallel

Report:
Expectation
  - Passed,failed,skipped  

50 testcases

10-Functional
20-Smoke
15-Regression
5- Sanity

Pre-requisite:
    Plugin
    dependency

Steps:
 1. Convert main method to a normal method    
      - Remove static keyword
      - Remove String[] args
      - Give meaningful methodname
      - Add @Test in top of the method
      - import @Test from org.testng.annotations
    
How to execute multiple testcases sequentially:
  - Select the required testcases marked with @Test
  - Right click-> Click TestNG at the bottom->Click convert to TestNG
  - A testng.xml wizard will appear
  - By default-Design tab would be selected 
  Note: Click Source tab to view the xml file
  - Finally run all the testcases sequentially and check the status


<Suite name="Leaftaps"> -> Collection of items
  <test name="Leads Module"> -> Collection of tests
   <classes>
    <class name="week5.day1.testcase.CreateLead"/>
    <class name="week5.day1.testcase.EditLead"/>
   </classes>
  </test>

  <test name="Accounts Module"> -> Collection of tests
   <class name="week5.day1.testcase.CreateAccount"/>
   <class name="week5.day1.testcase.EditAccount"/>
  </test>

</Suite>

verbose:
   It is an attribute to get the failure logs in the console
   default value of verbose is 2
  
Report:
  - After execution right click and refresh the project
  - test-output will appear
  - expand test-output folder-> index.html-> right click-> Open with-> System Editor
  - emailable-report.html

 thread-count:
   - Is used to control the number of threads to be opened parallely
   - Default value of thread-count="5"
Annotations Hierarchy:
  @BeforeSuite
     @BeforeTest
        @BeforeClass
           @BeforeMethod
             @Test
           @AfterMethod
        @AfterClass
     @AfterTest
  @AfterSuite           


Before Suite

Before Test
Before Class
        Before Method
       public void preCondition(){
             
       }
             Testcase 1(@Test)
    After Method
      
    Before Method
              Testcase 2(@Test)
    After Method
After Class    

Mandatory annotation in TestNg:
   @Test

Steps:
  1. Create a BaseClass and create 2 methods 
       - preCondition() and annotate with @BeforeMethod
       - postCondition() and annotate with @AfterMethod
  2. Declare ChromeDriver driver globally 
  3. Remove the common steps from all the classes 
  4. All the subclasses should inherit BaseClass  
  5. Finally execute from the testng.xml file
  6. Try to debug to understand the order of execution
